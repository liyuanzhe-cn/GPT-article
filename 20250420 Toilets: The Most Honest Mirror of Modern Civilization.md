Toilets: The Most Honest Mirror of Modern Civilization

Forget GDP, skyscrapers, and digital payment apps. If you want to know whether a country is truly civilized or merely performing modernity, don’t look up—look down. Walk into a public toilet.

That’s where the illusions fall away.

That’s where the infrastructure ends and the people begin.

That’s where the state’s design meets the citizen’s behavior.

And that’s where, in countries like China, a strange truth emerges:

You can build high-speed trains, but you still can’t build a clean toilet.
You can launch satellites, but you can’t keep your restroom from smelling like an ashtray.

I. The High-Speed Façade, the Low-Speed Toilet

In China, you’ll find some of the most impressive transport infrastructure in the world:
	•	Bullet trains that glide at 350km/h
	•	Futuristic train stations that rival airports
	•	5G coverage, QR code payment, AI-driven check-ins

But when you step into the restroom of a major high-speed rail station, you’re greeted with:
	•	Wet floors with mysterious puddles
	•	Overflowing bins of used tissue
	•	No soap, no paper, and sometimes, no water
	•	Urinals with cigarette butts
	•	Toilet stalls with unflushed contents
	•	And worst of all—smoke.

Yes, the modern Chinese public toilet, especially in train stations, has a tendency to double as an unofficial smoking lounge. This, in a space with “NO SMOKING” signs plastered on every wall. No one enforces the rules. No one dares speak up.

And the smell? A mixture of urine, cigarette smoke, and humidity.
Welcome to the hidden cost of “infrastructure-led development.”

II. Toilets Don’t Lie

You can stage a façade in public spaces:
	•	Clean train platforms? Easy.
	•	Facial recognition gates? Sure.
	•	Polite-sounding robot announcements? No problem.

But you cannot fake the condition of your toilets.

Toilets reveal whether a society truly respects people.
Toilets reveal whether the system truly cares about dignity.
Toilets reveal whether the idea of “public” means anything beyond propaganda.

If your bullet train station smells like a gas station in a failed state, what does that say about your priorities?

III. The Cultural Fault Line

In countries like Japan, Thailand, or parts of Europe, public toilets are:
	•	Clean
	•	Quiet
	•	Respectfully designed
	•	Often even aesthetic

There’s thought behind the layout:
	•	Privacy, hygiene, gender inclusivity, ease of cleaning, even scent control.

There’s enforcement:
	•	People don’t smoke inside.
	•	People flush.
	•	People wash their hands.
	•	People clean up after themselves—not because they’re afraid of cameras, but because they’ve been raised with a sense of shared space.

Compare that with the Chinese mindset still dominant in rural and semi-urban regions:
	•	Toilets are a private problem, not a public service
	•	Cleanliness is “your own job,” not a civic responsibility
	•	Smoking in toilets is “no big deal”
	•	Washing hands is optional
	•	Soap is a luxury
	•	Airflow? Who cares.

IV. The Rural Toilet Disaster

And it gets worse once you leave the cities.

In many Chinese villages, even in 2025:
	•	Public toilets are still “dry toilets” (non-flushing, pit-style)
	•	There’s no water, no drainage, no privacy
	•	They stink
	•	They’re shared by both genders
	•	And yet, weddings, funerals, banquets, and mass gatherings happen right across the street

It’s common to attend a 400-person wedding in a large rural restaurant that has no restroom.
Guests must cross the road to use a communal public toilet that lacks soap, running water, or even a sink. After relieving themselves, they return—without washing hands—to continue eating communally.

And this is somehow acceptable.

V. Why Does This Happen?

Because the Chinese development model doesn’t see toilets as a symbol of civilization. It sees them as a “low-priority amenity” that doesn’t bring visible political or economic returns.

Instead, the state pours billions into:
	•	Grand plazas
	•	Highway networks
	•	Artificial lakes
	•	Tech zones no one uses

But a functioning restroom?

“Just get by. Who cares if it stinks? People are used to it.”

That logic is rooted in decades of face-saving culture, where form always beats function, and in a bureaucratic machine that values what can be photographed, ranked, and bragged about in reports.

Toilets? Can’t put them in a PowerPoint.
Toilets? No ribbon-cutting ceremony.
Toilets? No flashy drone shots.

So toilets remain bad.

VI. Toilets Are Not Just About Hygiene

They’re about:
	•	Human dignity
	•	Public health
	•	Gender equity
	•	Disability access
	•	Class boundaries
	•	How a society treats its weakest and most vulnerable

If women can’t find a clean, private, safe place to relieve themselves, they stop going out.
If the disabled can’t access toilets, they’re excluded from public life.
If kids grow up thinking stinky, wet, smelly toilets are normal, they internalize filth as acceptable.

A clean, well-designed toilet is not a luxury—

It is the absolute minimum standard of respect one human being offers another in shared space.


VII. Conclusion: The Mirror Never Lies

We can argue endlessly about what defines a “civilized” country.
But the answer is hidden in plain sight—in a place we usually avoid talking about.

Want to measure civilization? Go to the toilet.

If your train station has facial recognition but the toilet is covered in piss and smoke, you’re not modern—you’re just pretending.

Civilization doesn’t begin with GDP.
It begins with the simple act of giving people a clean, functional, respectful place to relieve themselves, wash their hands, and walk out with their dignity intact.

If you want to see the soul of a country, look inside its bathroom.

Because the toilet never lies.
