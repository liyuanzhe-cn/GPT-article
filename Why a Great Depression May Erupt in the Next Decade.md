Why a Great Depression May Erupt in the Next Decade

Chapter I. Structural Shock from Technological Revolution

1. The Dual-Track AI Substitution Effect

As humanity steps into the AI-driven Fourth Industrial Revolution, a genuine “age of replacement” is quietly unfolding. AI is no longer a singular tool—it is evolving along two parallel tracks: hardware AI (robots) and software AI (algorithmic models). This dual-track evolution is systematically displacing human roles throughout production and service chains.

Robots are already handling concrete tasks like manufacturing, logistics, and operations, achieving high levels of automation in factories, warehouses, and transport sectors. Meanwhile, software AIs like GPT, Copilot, and Claude are steadily replacing “cognitive labor,” which traditionally supported the middle class—copywriting, coding, data analysis, even legal and medical consultation. Together, hardware and software AI are driving the marginal cost of production across industries toward zero.

This transformation initially presents as a false boom: the deployment phase creates new job categories such as AI trainers, algorithm optimizers, hardware technicians, and sensor calibrators. The AI hype has also triggered a sharp rise in tech stocks, further boosting consumer confidence among specific groups and creating a feedback loop of “tech boom → consumption revival.”

But the long-term impact will be far more disruptive. Once AI is fully deployed, massive structural unemployment will surface. According to a 2023 report by Boston Consulting Group, 23% of jobs worldwide will be at risk of automation by 2035. This wave of displacement will not just affect blue-collar laborers but will penetrate deeply into white-collar professions as well.

2. The Structural Disconnect Between Production and Consumption

At its core, the economy functions as a closed loop between production and consumption. But widespread AI adoption threatens to break this loop. On the surface, it’s rational for firms to boost profits by reducing labor costs through automation. The problem is: most firms are hoarding the gains from automation instead of redistributing them to workers or society.

According to 2023 U.S. corporate earnings data, AI-related capital expenditures among S&P 500 companies rose by 38%, while employee wages increased by only 4.2%. This growing disparity sidelines workers from the technology dividend, resulting in income stagnation and shrinking effective demand.

Research from MIT indicates that real purchasing power among the U.S. middle class has declined by 11% since 2000. Without adequate income, consumers cannot afford to buy the AI- and robot-generated goods and services—creating an economy with revving engines but no fuel.

3. The Restructuring of Globalization and the Fall of the Global South

Globalization once thrived on cheap labor and efficient resource allocation, but AI and robotics are now flipping that model. Breakthroughs in automation enable companies to produce domestically what they previously outsourced to low-wage nations—bypassing tariffs and cutting international costs.

Take Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory as an example. It has achieved a 95% automation rate, with some production lines requiring no human presence at all. As automation rises, the comparative advantage of cheap labor in developing countries diminishes—the so-called “demographic dividend” is vanishing.

Nigeria offers a telling example. Once hailed for its population-powered economic potential, its total fertility rate has dropped from 5.7 in 2010 to 4.8 in 2023. This decline is not solely due to education or urbanization—it reflects a growing pessimism about future employment and living prospects, which in turn shapes reproductive behavior.

Chapter II. The Neo-Malthusian Dilemma

4. From “Not Enough to Eat” to “Too Much to Use”: A Modern Malthusian Inversion

The classic Malthusian trap posits that population growth will eventually outpace food production, leading to scarcity, famine, and conflict. But in today’s world, that logic has been flipped: humanity is entering a trap of overabundance.

AI and robotics are ushering in an era of unprecedented productive capacity, yet consumer power is not rising in parallel. This creates a profound paradox of late-stage industrial capitalism—the more we produce, the less we sell.

Take China as an example. Since 2017, its industrial capacity utilization rate has remained below the 78% warning line for six consecutive years. This isn’t merely the result of overinvestment. It stems from a triple crisis: weak domestic demand, declining global exports, and technological substitution. The result? Systemic overproduction.

5. Destruction as Balance: War as an Economic Reset Tool

When a system’s productive capacity vastly exceeds its internal consumption, it faces two options: either restructure its distribution mechanisms or destroy part of its capacity to restore equilibrium. In reality, war often serves as the latter—a forced reset.

The war in Ukraine illustrates this pattern. Since 2022, over 40% of the country’s power generation infrastructure has been destroyed, and 37% of its manufacturing capacity lost. Yet the World Bank estimates $1.2 trillion will be needed for reconstruction, turning destruction into stimulus.

This is a textbook case of “destruction → reconstruction → economic stimulus”. Here, war is no longer a side effect of political ambition—it becomes a mechanism for eliminating excess capacity.

A deeper layer is the resurgence of neo-colonialism. Through proxy wars and regional conflicts, industrialization in developing countries is deliberately disrupted. Their remaining markets are then restructured by developed nations into consumption zones, reinforcing technological premiums and capital dominance.

Chapter III. The Failure of Policy Tools

6. The Decline of Keynesianism

Keynesian economics was once hailed as a universal remedy for cyclical crises. From the post-WWII era to the 2008 financial crisis, countless nations relied on government-led infrastructure investment, credit expansion, and employment programs to fuel economic growth. But that system is now entering its historical expiration phase.

The first sign of collapse lies in the diminishing returns of infrastructure investment. In China, the marginal effectiveness of infrastructure spending has significantly declined. According to a joint study by the Chinese Ministry of Finance and Tsinghua University, the ROI on infrastructure investment dropped from 3.7 in 2008 to just 0.9 in 2022. In other words, 1 yuan of investment now generates less than 1 yuan in GDP, signaling that the multiplier effect has nearly vanished.

The second issue is the black hole of maintenance costs. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that the U.S. currently faces a $2.6 trillion backlog in infrastructure maintenance. This isn’t just about building new bridges, roads, or power grids—it’s about keeping the old ones from crumbling, which severely limits future fiscal flexibility.

Thirdly, the classic Keynesian logic of “public investment → job creation” is being upended by AI. In today’s new infrastructure projects—whether data centers, AI industrial parks, or automated logistics systems—machines are doing the bulk of the work, and humans are being sidelined.

7. Debt: The Silent Fuse of Collapse

Modern fiscal policy has become heavily dependent on debt-driven growth, but under the triple pressure of low growth, low inflation, and high leverage, debt is no longer a growth engine—it’s becoming the penultimate straw breaking the system’s back.

Consider Japan: its government debt-to-GDP ratio has reached 264%, the highest among developed nations. While Japan manages to sustain this through a closed fiscal loop and sovereign currency, its model is neither scalable nor replicable. If global credit markets shift, a sovereign debt crisis could erupt without warning.

Worse still, AI infrastructure is accelerating the debt buildup. For every $1 invested in AI, an additional $0.80 is typically required for supporting infrastructure—data centers, power grid upgrades, and telecom expansion. Governments and corporations, in their race for “technological leadership,” are unknowingly piling on unsustainable debt.

This leads to a dangerous paradox: fiscal stimulus ends up enriching AI firms, chip manufacturers, and compute providers, while barely benefiting ordinary workers. This is the so-called robotic executor paradox: the more you invest, the fewer jobs you create, and the fruits of recovery concentrate in a handful of tech giants—tearing the social fabric even further.

Chapter IV. Collapse Pathways of the Economic System

8. The Global Replication of the Deflationary Spiral

A deflationary spiral refers to the vicious cycle where prices fall, corporate profits shrink, layoffs increase, consumer spending drops, and prices fall even further. Japan fell into this trap in the 1990s—and now, this pattern is spreading globally.

According to data from the European Central Bank, by Q4 of 2023, the eurozone’s core inflation had dropped to 2.9%, the lowest in years. At the same time, consumer confidence remains weak, while supply capacity keeps expanding, fueled by AI and the restructuring of global supply chains—further reinforcing deflationary pressures.

In the United States, deflation has not yet fully arrived, but signs of a liquidity trap are already clear. The Federal Reserve’s reverse repo balance consistently exceeds $2 trillion, indicating there is a massive surplus of idle capital with nowhere productive to go. The monetary transmission mechanism is effectively broken.

9. The Employment–Consumption Negative Feedback Loop

In theory, productivity gains should drive economic growth. But if job creation stagnates—or even contracts—then consumption lacks the foundation to absorb increased output. The economy begins to compress itself.

Amazon is a case in point. After aggressively automating its warehouses, its per-hour package throughput rose by 400%, yet its workforce shrank by 22%. This isn’t an outlier—it’s the new normal: more automation = fewer jobs.

Meanwhile, consumption downgrading is becoming a global trend. Walmart’s 2023 financial report showed that sales of low-cost goods grew more than three times faster than the rest of the market. This suggests that consumers are becoming poorer and more cautious, prioritizing price over quality.

The outcome isn’t inflation—it’s what we might call “social compression”: declining income, tighter credit, shrinking consumption, collapsing demand, and repeated rounds of layoffs. The economic system begins to shrink and paralyze itself—without war or plague.

Chapter V. Geopolitical Detonation Points

10. Conflict Externalization: How Politics Seeks Economic Outlets

Historically, major economic crises have almost always been followed by political attempts to shift the blame outward. After the Great Depression of the 1930s, fascism rose rapidly in Germany. The social unrest caused by economic collapse was absorbed through hatred of Jews and the thirst for revenge against the Allied victors.

Today, this playbook is being quietly revived. By 2023, the manufacturing PMIs of major global economies fell below the expansion threshold, with the global average at just 48.1—a clear sign of synchronized downturn.

At the same time, support for far-right parties in Europe has increased by over 210% compared to 2010. This growing wave of institutional distrust is fueling nationalism, xenophobia, and authoritarian tendencies, laying fertile ground for a new wave of techno-fascism. When people can no longer find hope in the economy, they turn to simple and aggressive political narratives—a ticking time bomb for global peace.

11. “Controlled Destruction” Warfare: The New Logic of Modern Conflict

Unlike the World Wars, which were based on total mobilization, mass casualties, and territorial conquest, modern wars are increasingly characterized by targeted technological destruction and population retention. The goal is no longer to annihilate people, but to destroy productive capacity in order to create space for economic reconstruction.

The Ukraine war has become a model case. In the Russia–Ukraine conflict, 37% of Ukraine’s manufacturing capacity was destroyed, yet urban centers and populations were largely preserved—laying the groundwork for a potential post-war consumer boom. This strategy of “destroy the factories but keep the people” serves as a tool for economic reset.

This is not just theoretical. Raytheon Technologies’ stock rose 38% during the Israel–Hamas conflict, highlighting the tight connection between war and finance. Defense giants like Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics are already pivoting toward a “war-rebuild-export” loop, forming what’s being called the “Military-Reconstruction Complex.”

When war becomes a tool to boost GDP, deploy capital, and expand markets, geopolitical conflicts cease to be purely strategic—they become an automatic release valve for internal economic contradictions.

Chapter  VI. The Possibility of Systemic Reconstruction

Though the outlook appears grim, crisis also opens windows for transformation. Humanity has faced systemic crises before, and collapse is not the only outcome—a new paradigm can emerge.

12. The Early Experiments of Post-Capitalism

Across various countries, non-traditional economic models are already being piloted at small scales:
	•	Universal Basic Income (UBI): In South Korea’s Gyeonggi Province, a UBI trial provided every resident with a monthly 10,000 won stipend. The result? A 1.8x consumption multiplier, suggesting that even small unconditional subsidies can significantly boost demand.
	•	Data as a Public Asset: China’s ongoing “East Data, West Computing” project is not just a technological initiative—it also represents an early experiment in treating data as a public resource. This could pave the way for a future where the dividends of data are distributed collectively.

While these experiments remain limited, they hint at a possible shift from capital-based distribution to presence-based distribution. In a world where labor is increasingly replaced by automation, ensuring broad participation in the AI dividend becomes the central challenge of institutional design.

13. A New Paradigm of Human–AI Symbiosis

The reconstruction of future systems won’t rely solely on political reform—it will require a redefinition of the relationship between humans and technology.
	•	Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) technology has made major breakthroughs in clinical trials. Neuralink experiments have shown that human brainwaves can control robotic limbs with 92% accuracy, pointing toward a future where humans extend their capabilities through technology.
	•	Emotional Economy is emerging as a new frontier. The global companion robot market is growing at 61% CAGR, showing that people, having lost traditional jobs and roles, are seeking emotional fulfillment through digital surrogates.

In this context, the focus may shift from “humans resisting AI” to a new societal form—one where humans and machines collaborate, co-perceive, and redefine value together.

Chapter VII. Crisis Timeline & Civilizational Choices

History does not explode out of nowhere. It simmers quietly—until it erupts all at once. Today, we are in the final stages of that simmering period.

14. Trigger Points: 2028–2035

According to predictive models from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the risk of systemic crises is no longer theoretical—it is statistically probable. The IMF’s confidence-level projections show:
	•	2028–2030: There is a 74% probability that major global economies will enter synchronized technical recessions. This phase will likely witness:
	•	A burst in the AI-driven tech bubble
	•	Rapid rise in corporate and sovereign defaults
	•	Massive job losses across multiple sectors
	•	2032–2035: More than 20 countries may face sovereign debt crises, with some developing nations experiencing monetary collapse or political regime change.

15. A Civilizational Fork in the Road

By the year 2040, humanity could reach a pivotal crossroad—a civilizational bifurcation:
	•	Path One: Stabilized Symbiosis
Through reforms in institutional systems, technological governance, and ethical frameworks, society successfully transitions from an employment-based economy to a distribution-based one.
AI and humans coexist, and stability returns.
The seeds of a new symbiotic civilization are planted.
	•	Path Two: Cyclical Destruction and Rebirth
If reform stalls, if AI dividends remain highly concentrated, and if inequality continues to grow, the world may relapse into a 1930s-style loop of collapse and reconstruction—marked by:
	•	Global conflict
	•	Authoritarian resurgence
	•	Mass displacement or depopulation
	•	Industrial reset through war or catastrophe

This systemic projection echoes Schumpeter’s theory of creative destruction, and closely aligns with Carlota Perez’s model of technological revolution and financial capital cycles.

Conclusion: The Symbiosis of Disaster and Hope

The next ten to fifteen years will be the most dangerous period humanity has faced since the Second World War. We stand at a fragile equilibrium, teetering between two worlds:
	•	On one side: decline, division, and collapse
	•	On the other: reconstruction, cooperation, and transcendence

A new Great Depression may indeed be on the horizon—but so too might be the dawn of a post-industrial civilization.
