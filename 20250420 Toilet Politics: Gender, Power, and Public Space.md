Toilet Politics: Gender, Power, and Public Space

When we think about gender inequality, our minds often go to wages, workplace harassment, or political representation. But what if I told you that one of the most persistent and invisible forms of gender-based exclusion is happening in the places we all visit multiple times a day — the toilet?

Restrooms are not just sanitation facilities. They are deeply gendered, deeply political, and often mirror how societies value — or fail to value — the needs, dignity, and safety of women and marginalized bodies.

I. Toilets Aren’t Just Toilets — They’re Social Mirrors

A toilet is one of the rare spaces in modern society where the public and the private intersect. It is a basic human need, yet the ability to access a clean, safe, and functional toilet is not evenly distributed.

Men can often relieve themselves in almost any situation — urinals, walls, even the open air. Women, however, require more time, privacy, and physical safety to do the same. And yet:

 •	Public restrooms are often designed without female physiology in mind.

 •	Women wait in lines up to 6x longer than men in many countries.

 •	Construction sites, festivals, parks, and transport hubs often have fewer or no women’s toilets at all.

 •	In rural and urban areas alike, women are forced to dehydrate themselves to avoid using unsafe or unsanitary toilets.

This is not a logistical problem — this is a design failure rooted in a male-default worldview.

II. The Construction Site: Where Gender Disappears

Let’s talk about one of the most egregious examples of toilet-based gender neglect: the modern construction site.

In many developing countries — including China — construction projects can last 3, 5, even 10 years. These sites host thousands of workers, including not only male laborers, but also female engineers, architects, and site managers.

And yet:

 •	Toilets on site are often a single open pit, covered with a shaky metal sheet, no doors, no locks, and no gender separation.

 •	There are no provisions for women’s hygiene, no running water, no waste bins, and no lighting.

 •	Women often go all day without drinking water, fearing they’ll need to use the toilet.

 •	Complaints about this are dismissed as “overly sensitive,” or worse, “not tough enough for construction.”

This is not a resource issue. These sites are worth millions, even billions. They have the budget for cranes, drones, surveillance systems — but not for a single decent women’s restroom.

That’s not efficiency. That’s gendered contempt disguised as pragmatism.

III. Gendered Architecture Is Political

Every building, every park, every train station — someone decides how space is allocated, how wide the stalls are, how many toilets exist for each gender, whether there’s a place to wash your hands, change a child’s diaper, manage menstruation, or feel safe.

Those decisions are not neutral. They’re embedded with:

 •	Cultural assumptions about who belongs in public space;

 •	Historical neglect of women’s needs;

 •	Economic biases that view male bodies as default, and female needs as “optional add-ons.”

Think about this:

 •	Men’s restrooms are often twice as fast to get in and out of.

 •	Women’s restrooms require more space, more time, and more privacy — yet they’re often given less room.

 •	Trans and nonbinary individuals often face outright violence for entering either restroom.

A society that builds its spaces around speed and output rather than care and accessibility is a society that structurally marginalizes those who menstruate, nurse, and simply need a clean, safe place to exist.

IV. The Western Myth

“But it’s better in the West,” some say.

Not so fast.

While many Western countries have better sanitation infrastructure, the gendered politics of space still persist:

 •	Women’s restrooms are still under-provisioned in stadiums, music venues, and festivals.

 •	Homeless women face greater hygiene challenges than men.

 •	Menstruation, postpartum recovery, and menopause are rarely considered in urban planning.

Even in New York City or London, finding a clean, accessible, free toilet for women is not guaranteed. And when budgets are tight, gendered facilities are among the first to be cut.

V. What Would a Gender-Inclusive Toilet System Look Like?

 •	Equal stall-to-need ratio, not just “equal numbers.”

 •	Universal design that considers menstruation, childcare, and disability.

 •	Privacy-first layouts, not just more urinals and open gaps.

 •	Mandatory clean water, soap, and disposal units.

 •	Safety and surveillance measures that don’t criminalize marginalized users.

Public toilets should be considered essential infrastructure, like roads, schools, or hospitals.
They are not a luxury. They are not optional.

VI. Final Thought: Sanitation is Liberation

The toilet is a human right — and a feminist issue.

When we dismiss toilet access as a minor inconvenience, we ignore the daily humiliations, health risks, and social exclusion that millions endure.
When we ignore the lack of female-friendly design, we perpetuate a world literally not built for half its population.

It’s time to stop treating restrooms as afterthoughts — and start treating them as barometers of real equality.

Because if your city has skyscrapers, bullet trains, and AI surveillance,
but women still can’t pee safely,
that’s not civilization — that’s performance.
